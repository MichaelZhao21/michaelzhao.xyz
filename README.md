# My personal website!

This is my personal website!! I'm currently using (and learning) [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), which is built off of the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework. I chose to use Vue because I needed a simple templating framework and Nuxt because it manages SSR and SEO much better than I could myself. Currently, I am hosting the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which also automatically builds and deploys the site (you can even see the deployment status by clicking the badge above!).

## Scripts

* Development Run: `yarn dev`
* Build: `yarn build`
* Production Run: `yarn start` (need to build first)
